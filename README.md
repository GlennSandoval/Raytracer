Raytracer
==================

An example image rendered with my ray tracer can be seen on <a href="http://www.ercarlson.com/raytracing.html">my website</a>.

Ray tracer in C++. Started for CSCE 647 (Image Synthesis) class in Spring 2013, but decided to continue adding features. Implemented optimizations including a KD tree for intersection tests on large polygonal meshes and multithreading.

Uses the <a href="http://cimg.sourceforge.net/">CImg</a> library and the <a href="http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/">tinyxml2</a> library.
